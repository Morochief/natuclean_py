Create a dynamic and interactive "Product Detail" view for a specific candle.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy from DESIGN.md Section 6]
- Use specific "Zen" typography (Playfair Display for headers).
- Layout: Split screen (Left: Large immersive image, Right: Product details and 'Add to Cart').
- Interactive elements: Scent notes visualization (Top/Middle/Base notes).

**Goal:**
- Create a new Astro page `src/pages/product/[id].astro`.
- Use Solid.js for the "Add to Cart" counter and interactive scent notes.
- Ensure it looks like a high-end spa product page.
